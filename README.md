The World Engine, as the name suggests, facilitates in creating the worlds which is used in
the various levels of the game. It brings together the background, foreground and game physics
into one space. The World Engine enables the game developers to preview their creation ,animations
and lets them let their imaginations run wild.
The game Momentum is a platform type game where the objective is to complete a level in the 
least time possible. It allows multiple users to login and have their credentials saved and
retrieved whenever necessary. Momentum provides an immersive experience to the gamer,
and provides the gamer with 3 unique worlds punctuated with dynamic weather elements .
